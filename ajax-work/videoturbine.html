            YouTube, Facebook, and eCommerce sites to find product videos that will assist in their online purchase decisions.

            Video production is associated with high cost, specialized labor, technical jargon and opaque creativity, which makes the
            user experience difficult for <i>clients</i> and <i>producers</i>.
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>
            For Clients:
          </h6>
          <p> Budgets for video projects range drastically, from hundreds of dollars to millions, with sometimes seemingly little
            difference between end results. This leaves clients feeling uncertain about the value of money spent on video
            services, and wary of being taken advantage of.
            <p>
              </br>
              <h6>
                For Producers:
              </h6>
              <p> Because clients are often cautious or unfamiliar with the video production process, producers bear the responsibility
                of proving their worth- explaining and justifying costs, and reassuring clients of shared expectations. Producers
                are worried that clients will be unsatisfied with work produced, and are similarly wary of being exploited
                or cheated.

              <p>Overall, this lack of mutual trust and understanding results in friction and reduced efficiency throughout

            Video production companies treat each video project as a unique idea, with a creative process that can last for weeks and
            cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to several million. With such a massive volume of commercial videos
            being produced every day, what is the likelihood that each individual video actually benefits from being treated
            as unique? While certain videos may require a full creative process (e.g., comedic or cinematic tv commercials),
            many videos designed for eCommerce and social media ("Insider" style product demos, "Tasty" style aerial food
            recipe videos) are strikingly similar in style and content, presenting the opportunity for a streamlined approach.

            <!--             
            It is highly probable that time and money is being wasted on applying this bespoke
            creative process to templatable video types, such as eCommerce product videos, which are homogenous in style
            and content, and built for delivery of information rather than creative storytelling. -->

            The user begins by using our Video Builder tool to select a product video template (full actor demo, hand demo, or 360 spin).
            They are then provided with options based on that template (e.g., backdrop color). By having full control over
            these options and completely transparent pricing, they are able to feel confident about the details of their
            video prior to submitting the order. Once they submit the order, they simply print out a shipping label and send
            us their product. During this waiting period, they are never in the dark- the online order tracker updates them
            at each step of the production process. Once the video is complete, they have the option to request one revision
            before receiving a download link to their video in web and social-media-ready formats, as well as all raw footage.

          <!-- 
          If the client
            wishes to have a voiceover or actor speaking in the video, they will need a script made. Through user research,
            we aimed to simplify the script-writing process, and ultimately found that all clients need to do is send over
            a list of product features. We can then respond with a script for their review. Once the client approves the script, they
            print out their shipping label, send us their product, and wait. -->

          </br>
       

          <h6>Background</h6>
          <h3>We created a prototype of Video Turbine that is a live, fully functioning WooCommerce website.</h3>
          <p> This decision was a tradeoff between control over visual design and functionality, but we ultimately decided while
            typically, mockups can test the usability and desirability of a product, that the increased functionality and
            authenticity of a real eCommerce site would help us better assess whether businesses would actually be willing
            to 'shop' for their video online, the same way they would use an eCommerce site to buy other products. Additionally,
            to assess desirability, we created an explainer video (see above) for the service which we intend to send around
            to business owners along with a questionaire. Lastly, throughout the website, we are collecting constant feedback
            through a Suggestion Box form and a Desired Features poll.</p>
          </br>
          </br>

          <h6>Research Question:</h6>
          <h3>How can we make Video Turbine more usable?</h3>
          <p>
            To find ways to improve the usability of interactions on Video Turbine, we sat down with 3 of our friends and had them build
            a video while thinking aloud and explaining what they thought each step and feature was. They were instructed
            to 'build a video that looks like this' (we showed them an example video that was not created by Video Turbine).
            This simple exercise gave us extremely valuable insights both about micro-interactions on the site and copy improvements,
            but also on desired features. Below is an example of feedback from one step in the video-building process.</p>

          <p>
            Hopefully! We are in the process of using a combination of our live prototype, our explainer video, and Google Analytics
            to test this through user and market research.

          <h5>Testing Feasibility of Pre-Production via an Interface.</h5>
          </br>
          <h6>Background:</h6>
          <h3>Cognitive and market research show that people tend to be happier, less anxious, and more confident making choices
            when there are fewer options (known as the Paradox of Choice).</h3>

          <p>There is a reason why Squarespace is more user friendly than Wix: Squarespace provides choice within limitation,
            whereas Wix promotes customizing every pixel. How many of us have spent hours designing our own sneakers on NikeID,
            only to never actually purchase them, opting instead for their predesigned shoes despite the price similarity?
            After our collaborative design exercise, we felt that using an interface to 'shop' video features could take
            the place of an in-person consultation, and that the added transparency could increase users' confidence about
            what their resulting video would look like. Of course, we were wary of overwhelming users by requiring them to
            choose every little detail about the video: We wanted users to have just enough control to feel confident about
            what they were ordering, without burdening them with too much choice.
            </br>
            </br>

            <h6>Research Question:</h6>
            <h3>Can we produce a product video that matches the quality and style of what the user had in mind, using only the
              information collected through our interface?</h3>

            <p>
              So, we sought out to test what was the abolute minimal information a video producer needed in order to create the product
              video the user had in mind. Despite Evan's lengthy consulation meetings and emails with clients as a freelancer,
              he felt that he only required the following information from them: whether they wanted a solid-color backdrop
              or studio location, whether there would be actors involved, and what specific features of the product should
              be demonstrated. I found a video of a product demo online and attempted to have Evan recreate it without ever
              watching it. I only provided him with the kinds of details easily attained from an interface (Backdrop color,
              Voiceover or Actor Speaking on Camera, Captions or No Captions, Duration, and Script). The resulting video
              was, in our opinion, comparable in style and content, and equivalent or better in quality. We are in the process
              of conducting a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, to find out from an unbiased audience which of the two videos
              demonstrates higher quality, which video they prefer, and which video better represented the product. I will
              post the results when this survey is complete.

              </br>
              </br>
              By having Evan reproduce this video using only the simple instructions I provided, we verified that it is indeed feasible
              to produce high quality product videos with limited instructions communicated solely through an interface.
              We also realized that we either need to limit the types of products we create videos for, or provide a few
              more options that are product-specific. For instance, in the video Evan reproduced for this exercise, the original
              actor wears the product (boots) for a few seconds on camera. If we were to offer apparel videos, we would need
              to either enable users to specify whether the apparel should be worn and how (e.g., the original actor had
              pants that covered the upper portion of the boots), or alternatively, make it clear that the apparel will not
              be showcased on an actual person. Lastly, in this exercise, I provided a verbatim copy of the original script,
              which many of Evan's regular clients do, but we hypothesized that we could reduce the workload of many clients
              by having them instead provide a list of product features, and have us generate a draft of a script for them,
              along with a corresponding shot list that makes it clear what visual will be displayed during each line of
              the script (e.g., when the script says "This shoe has a flexible sole", a corresponding note might say "Actor
              uses both hands to slightly bend shoe").
