          <h5>Video has become increasingly important for businesses.
          </h5>
          <p>Videos are being used more than ever before for advertising products on the internet. Consumers are looking to
            YouTube, Facebook, and eCommerce sites to find product videos that will assist in their online purchase decisions.

          <h6>Yet having videos made is a pain.</h6>
          <p>Despite the increasing volume of videos needed, getting a commercial product video produced has yet to be streamlined.
            The chart below depicts the findings from a survey of US ad buyers who cited the following challenges in buying
            commercial video (% of respondents, eMarketer 2015). </p>

          <p>
            Video production is associated with high cost, specialized labor, technical jargon and opaque creativity, which makes the
            user experience difficult for <i>clients</i> and <i>producers</i>.
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>
            For Clients:
          </h6>
          <p> Budgets for video projects range drastically, from hundreds of dollars to millions, with sometimes seemingly little
            difference between end results. This leaves clients feeling uncertain about the value of money spent on video
            services, and wary of being taken advantage of.
            <p>
              </br>
              <h6>
                For Producers:
              </h6>
              <p> Because clients are often cautious or unfamiliar with the video production process, producers bear the responsibility
                of proving their worth- explaining and justifying costs, and reassuring clients of shared expectations. Producers
                are worried that clients will be unsatisfied with work produced, and are similarly wary of being exploited
                or cheated.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Overall, this lack of mutual trust and understanding results in friction and reduced efficiency throughout
                the entire process for both parties.</p>

            A survey of 15 video production company websites revealed strong similarities in process descriptions. A subject matter expert
            interview confirmed this process description and added qualitative insights regarding workload and client concerns
            during each step. This chart depicts a typical video production process, as described by this research.

            Video production companies treat each video project as a unique idea, with a creative process that can last for weeks and
            cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to several million. With such a massive volume of commercial videos
            being produced every day, what is the likelihood that each individual video actually benefits from being treated
            as unique? While certain videos may require a full creative process (e.g., comedic or cinematic tv commercials),
            many videos designed for eCommerce and social media ("Insider" style product demos, "Tasty" style aerial food
            recipe videos) are strikingly similar in style and content, presenting the opportunity for a streamlined approach.

            <!--             
            It is highly probable that time and money is being wasted on applying this bespoke
            creative process to templatable video types, such as eCommerce product videos, which are homogenous in style
            and content, and built for delivery of information rather than creative storytelling. -->

          <p>A simplified model of our system shows orders placed by clients using the Video Turbine Website. Our team then
            recieves details of these orders as instructions, and schedules production activities in a way that maximizes
            efficiency (e.g, all videos the require a white backdrop are shot at the same time). Meanwhile, the client is
            informed of shoot progress via the video tracker.</p>

          <h5 class="margin-top-80">User Flow for ordering an eCommerce Product Video</h5>
          <p>
            The user begins by using our Video Builder tool to select a product video template (full actor demo, hand demo, or
            360 spin). They are then provided with options based on that template (e.g., backdrop color). By having full control over these options and completely transparent pricing, they are
            able to feel confident about the details of their video prior to submitting the order. Once they submit the order, they simply
            print out a shipping label and send us their product. During this waiting period, they are never in the dark- the online order tracker updates them at
            each step of the production process. Once the video is complete, they have the option to request one revision before receiving a download link to their video in web and social-media-ready formats, as well as all raw footage.

          </p>
<!-- 
          If the client
            wishes to have a voiceover or actor speaking in the video, they will need a script made. Through user research,
            we aimed to simplify the script-writing process, and ultimately found that all clients need to do is send over
            a list of product features. We can then respond with a script for their review. Once the client approves the script, they
            print out their shipping label, send us their product, and wait. -->
