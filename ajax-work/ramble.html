        <h4>45% of women in the US reported feeling unsafe walking alone at night</h4>
        <h6>GALLUP 2016</h6>
        </br>
        <p>While women are actually less likely to be the victims of street crime than men, they tend to be more afraid of it,
          which is often referred to as "the fear of crime paradox" (Pryor, 2013). For the scope of this project, we chose
          to exclusively focus on women because the nature of <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women’s fear tends to differ from men’s fear in both its cause and effect</span>:
          women tend to be afraid of sexual violence and sexual harassment in particular, leading them to develop specific
          preventative strategies of distancing themselves in both space and time from potential attackers. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Importantly, fear of walking is hypothesized to further restrict the freedoms of women</span>          (Pryor et al. 2013). Women’s mobility is restricted by the perception of certain spaces as being unsafe, a product
          of women’s historical exclusion from these spaces, and by the harassment and violence they face currently that
          continues to reduce their inclusion from these spaces. Notably, what this suggests is that walking inequality perpetuates
          itself, that <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women's fear may be both a result and cause of women’s inequality</span>          (Koskela, 2000).</p>

      <p>Walking alone is for many an everyday experience and though physical assault is relatively rare, fear and uneasiness
        is all too common and felt regardless, influencing walking behavior and attitudes. There are many existing products
        that aid walkers in the midst of an attack, but none that support walkers continuous fears. Due to fear being a function
        of a larger societal issue, we chose to consider solutions beyond the context of the immediate walk.</p>

        <h6>feature 1:</h6>
        <h3>pair with a walking partner</h3>
        <p>Ramble connects single walkers together in order to virtually monitor each other’s progress towards their respective final destinations. In our primary research, we found that participants had a desire to reach out to another person during their walk, but were reluctant to do so, citing reasons like wanting to avoid causing friends and family to worry, feeling embarrassed about being afraid, and feeling insecure about whether their fears were justified. By connecting strangers who are both walking alone, Ramble provides walkers with the presence of another person while eliminating the concern of burdening loved ones. Ramble keeps paired walkers identities anonymous, meaning walkers do not know each other’s names or exact locations. Walkers only know when their partner has departed and whether they have reached their end destination. Personally identifiable information is hidden in an effort to reduce the potential for predators to use this information for harmful purposes. Participants who tested the prototype of our concept found comfort and value in the other entity being another person, as opposed to an automated machine. For this reason, we included humanizing details, such as the region a walking partner is currently in, as well as a personalized avatar. Walkers can signal discomfort through discreet haptic feedback to their partner by simply pressing the volume button. Partners can provide each other with a sense of comfort by reciprocating this button press. This simple interaction allows our users to acknowledge their discomfort and express it without the concern of overreacting and without having to look at the phone screen, which could distract walkers, making them more vulnerable. Most importantly, it was crucial that this interaction was as simple as possible because in threatening situations, executive functioning failure is common. Pressing the volume button has additional benefits beyond communicating unease. The button press also captures the GPS coordinates of the location where the user felt uneasy. A rapid multi-press can dial 911 where a system recording will provide your GPS location to the dispatcher before switching to the phone’s microphone to capture live audio. Alternatively, walkers can customize other escalation preferences, such as setting emergency contacts.</p>

        <h6>feature 2:</h6>
        <h3>location-tagged, qualitative data collection for city planners</h3>
        <p>Ramble combines location data with qualitative report data to provide organizations with influence on pedestrian safety with information regarding areas in which users feel unsafe, as well as information regarding the effectiveness of existing interventions. Through literature reviews and subject matter experts, we learned that there are different types of environmental factors that may signal to walkers that there is heightened risk of walking in a certain area and importantly, contribute to the potential for attack. Fortunately, there are also environmental characteristics that may work to deter crime by creating “defensible space," thereby reducing the likelihood of attack. It was important that our design solution leverage “Community Activation," which is a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) term used to encourage community members to “work together to ensure each other’s safety.” As we learned from a subject matter expert, the most impactful solutions are ones that lower the threshold for reporting so that more people share their experiences. When walkers use their volume buttons during the walk to signal unease, that information is geo-tagged. Once the walker finishes their walk, they can use qualitative tags to describe their walking experience. This form of incident reporting is powerful for at least three reasons: first, it empowers walkers to influence their walking environment, second, the knowledge that their incident reporting 'makes a difference', may reduce walkers' threshold to report, and third, with existing data collection methods, CPTED experts often do not have the scale and specificity of data they need to find out if their design strategies were effective.

        <h6>feature 3:</h6>
        <h3>engage with your walking community through a social media feed</h3>
        <p>In addition to sharing aggregated user reports, Ramble also encourages walkers to share their walking experiences with others in the nearby vicinity via a social media channel. This social media channel helps normalize discussions around the threats that women face while walking alone, as well as provide information that could help other walkers make more informed decisions and become aware of potentially dangerous situations in the area. Our concept prototype evaluation revealed that participants do not necessarily want conversational “social” content and were concerned about the potential negative impact of having a stream of horrendous events. We decided to shape the content of the news feed so that it includes both user generated content and system generated content that strikes a tone that is more actionable and informative. User generated content takes the form of a so-called “heads up” to other walkers in the area, as opposed to a forum for venting frustrations. This can also be empowering as our walkers’ experiences could be validated by, or overlap, with each others’. In addition to user generated content, the news feed would also include engaging system generated content in the form of safety tips and interactive questions and polls, which our research participants were very keen on.</p>

        <h3>learn effective defense strategies through scientifically-backed safety tips</h3>
        <p>Our primary research surfaced that participants were not confident in their ability to effectively assess or respond to risks. We met with a martial arts and self defense instructor, Gailyn Perrin, to understand what knowledge is crucial to walking safety, which parts of her curriculum resonate well with students, and what types of information can be transferred well through an app. Our resulting education approach manifests in the form of Safety Tips, which are brief, casual and relatable tidbits grounded in research. These tips promote awareness of one’s surroundings, the importance of paying attention to intuition, how to carry oneself in order to reduce the chances of being targeted, and ways to respond to assailants. As recommended by Gailyn, these tips are written to be memorable and simple to understand and execute. </p>
