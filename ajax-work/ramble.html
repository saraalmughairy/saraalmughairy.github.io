              <h4>45% of women in the US reported feeling unsafe walking alone at night</h4>
              <h6 >GALLUP 2016</h6> </br>
              <p>While women are actually less likely to be the victims of street crime than men, they tend to be more afraid of it, which is often referred to as "the fear of crime paradox" (Pryor, 2013). For the scope of this project, we chose to exclusively focus on women because the nature of <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women’s fear tends to differ from men’s fear in both its cause and effect</span>: women tend to be afraid of sexual violence and sexual harassment in particular, leading them to develop specific preventative strategies of distancing themselves in both space and time from potential attackers. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Importantly, fear of walking is hypothesized to further restrict the freedoms of women</span> (Pryor et al. 2013). Women’s mobility is restricted by the perception of certain spaces as masculine, a product of women’s historical exclusion from these spaces, and by the harassment and violence they face in some spaces. Notably, what this suggests is that walking inequality perpetuates itself, that <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women's fear may be both a result and cause of women’s inequality</span> (Koskela, 2000).</p>

        <h3>How can we help women <i>be</i> and <i>feel</i> safer when walking alone?</span></h3>
        <p>Walking alone is for many an everyday experience and though physical assault is relatively rare, fear and uneasiness is all too common and felt regardless, influencing walking behavior and attitudes. There are many products that focus on seeking help in the midst of an attack, but none that holistically target the walking experience. Further, due to fear being a function of a larger societal issue, we also chose to consider solutions beyond the context of the immediate walk.</p>
