        <h4>45% of women in the US reported feeling unsafe walking alone at night</h4>
        <h6>GALLUP 2016</h6>
        </br>
        <p>While women are actually less likely to be the victims of street crime than men, they tend to be more afraid of it,
          which is often referred to as "the fear of crime paradox" (Pryor, 2013). For the scope of this project, we chose
          to exclusively focus on women because the nature of <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women’s fear tends to differ from men’s fear in both its cause and effect</span>:
          women tend to be afraid of sexual violence and sexual harassment in particular, leading them to develop specific
          preventative strategies of distancing themselves in both space and time from potential attackers. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Importantly, fear of walking is hypothesized to further restrict the freedoms of women</span>          (Pryor et al. 2013). Women’s mobility is restricted by the perception of certain spaces as being unsafe, a product
          of women’s historical exclusion from these spaces, and by the harassment and violence they face currently that
          continues to reduce their inclusion from these spaces. Notably, what this suggests is that walking inequality perpetuates
          itself, that <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women's fear may be both a result and cause of women’s inequality</span>          (Koskela, 2000).</p>

      <h5>How can we help women <i>be</i> and <i>feel</i> safer when walking alone?</span>
      </h5>
      <p>Walking alone is for many an everyday experience and though physical assault is relatively rare, fear and uneasiness
        is all too common and felt regardless, influencing walking behavior and attitudes. There are many existing products
        that aid walkers in the midst of an attack, but none that support walkers continuous fears. Due to fear being a function
        of a larger societal issue, we chose to consider solutions beyond the context of the immediate walk.</p>

        <h6>feature 1:</h6>
        <h3>get paired with a walking partner</h3>
        <p>Ramble connects single walkers to virtually and anonymously monitor each others’ progress towards their respective
          destinations. By connecting strangers who are both walking alone, Ramble provides walkers with the presence of
          others while simultaneously eliminating the concern of burdening loved ones. Our prototype testers found comfort
          in knowing they were connected to another person having a similar experience, though they were anonymous.Communication
          of Unease through the Volume Button Despite participants feeling safer with others, we found a general silence
          around communication of fear. Ramble attempts to lower the threshold for communication by allowing users to signal
          discomfort through discreet haptic feedback to their partner by pressing the volume button. Partners can provide
          each other with a sense of comfort by reciprocating this button press. Pressing the volume button also captures
          the GPS coordinates of the location where the user felt uneasy, enabling the collection of data points that may
          be qualitatively enhanced through a subsequent reporting prompt. Also, a rapid multi-press can connect to 911,
          or alternately, to the user’s pre-set escalation preferences.</p>

        <h3>stay in touch with your walking community through a shared feed</h3>
        <p>In addition to sharing walking reports, Ramble also encourages users to share their experiences with their local
          community via the news feed. This channel helps normalize discussion as well as disseminate information. However,
          our concept prototype evaluation revealed a wariness towards user content. Participants didn’t want conversational
          “social” content and thought they might be put-off by reading a stream of scary incidents. We decided to shape
          the content of the news feed with both user and system generated content to strikes a more positive and actionable
          tone. System generated content would take the form of safety tips and interactive questions and polls. We believe
          that a combination of relevant local information and conversation, as well as educational content, strikes the
          right balance between social and actionable.</p>

The third aspect of our application concept is an education component that manifests itself in the form of Safety Tips, which are brief, casual, and relatable tidbits grounded in research.

These tips promote awareness of one’s surroundings, the importance of paying attention to intuition, how to carry oneself in order to reduce the chances of being targeted, and ways to respond to assailants.</p>
