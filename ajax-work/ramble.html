        <h4>45% of women in the US reported feeling unsafe walking alone at night</h4>
        <h6>GALLUP 2016</h6>
        </br>
        <p>While women are actually less likely to be the victims of street crime than men, they tend to be more afraid of it,
          which is often referred to as "the fear of crime paradox" (Pryor, 2013). For the scope of this project, we chose
          to exclusively focus on women because the nature of <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women’s fear tends to differ from men’s fear in both its cause and effect</span>:
          women tend to be afraid of sexual violence and sexual harassment in particular, leading them to develop specific
          preventative strategies of distancing themselves in both space and time from potential attackers. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Importantly, fear of walking is hypothesized to further restrict the freedoms of women</span>          (Pryor et al. 2013). Women’s mobility is restricted by the perception of certain spaces as being unsafe, a product
          of women’s historical exclusion from these spaces, and by the harassment and violence they face currently that
          continues to reduce their inclusion from these spaces. Notably, what this suggests is that walking inequality perpetuates
          itself, that <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">women's fear may be both a result and cause of women’s inequality</span>          (Koskela, 2000).</p>

      <p>Walking alone is for many an everyday experience and though physical assault is relatively rare, fear and uneasiness
        is all too common and felt regardless, influencing walking behavior and attitudes. There are many existing products
        that aid walkers in the midst of an attack, but none that support walkers continuous fears. Due to fear being a function
        of a larger societal issue, we chose to consider solutions beyond the context of the immediate walk.</p>

        <h6>feature 1:</h6>
        <h3>pair with a walking partner</h3>
        <p>Ramble connects single walkers together in order to virtually monitor each other’s progress towards their respective
          final destinations. In our primary research, we found that participants had a desire to reach out to another person
          during their walk, but were reluctant to do so, citing reasons like wanting to avoid causing friends and family
          to worry, feeling embarrassed about being afraid, and feeling insecure about whether their fears were justified.
          By connecting strangers who are both walking alone, Ramble provides walkers with the presence of another person
          while eliminating the concern of burdening loved ones. Ramble keeps paired walkers identities anonymous, meaning
          walkers do not know each other’s names or exact locations. Walkers only know when their partner has departed and
          whether they have reached their end destination. Personally identifiable information is hidden in an effort to
          reduce the potential for predators to use this information for harmful purposes. Participants who tested the prototype
          of our concept found comfort and value in the other entity being another person, as opposed to an automated machine.
          For this reason, we included humanizing details, such as the region a walking partner is currently in, as well
          as a personalized avatar. Walkers can signal discomfort through discreet haptic feedback to their partner by simply
          pressing the volume button. Partners can provide each other with a sense of comfort by reciprocating this button
          press. This simple interaction allows our users to acknowledge their discomfort and express it without the concern
          of overreacting and without having to look at the phone screen, which could distract walkers, making them more
          vulnerable. Most importantly, it was crucial that this interaction was as simple as possible because in threatening
          situations, executive functioning failure is common. Pressing the volume button has additional benefits beyond
          communicating unease. The button press also captures the GPS coordinates of the location where the user felt uneasy.
          A rapid multi-press can dial 911 where a system recording will provide your GPS location to the dispatcher before
          switching to the phone’s microphone to capture live audio. Alternatively, walkers can customize other escalation
          preferences, such as setting emergency contacts.</p>

      <h3>location-tagged, qualitative data collection for city planners</h3>
      <p>Ramble combines location data with qualitative report data to provide organizations with influence on pedestrian safety
        with information regarding areas in which users feel unsafe, as well as information regarding the effectiveness of
        existing interventions. Through literature reviews and subject matter experts, we learned that there are different
        types of environmental factors that may signal to walkers that there is heightened risk of walking in a certain area
        and importantly, contribute to the potential for attack. Fortunately, there are also environmental characteristics
        that may work to deter crime by creating “defensible space," thereby reducing the likelihood of attack. It was important
        that our design solution leverage “Community Activation," which is a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
        (CPTED) term used to encourage community members to “work together to ensure each other’s safety.” As we learned
        from a subject matter expert, the most impactful solutions are ones that lower the threshold for reporting so that
        more people share their experiences. When walkers use their volume buttons during the walk to signal unease, that
        information is geo-tagged. Once the walker finishes their walk, they can use qualitative tags to describe their walking
        experience. This form of incident reporting is powerful for at least three reasons: first, it empowers walkers to
        influence their walking environment, second, the knowledge that their incident reporting 'makes a difference', may
        reduce walkers' threshold to report, and third, with existing data collection methods, CPTED experts often do not
        have the scale and specificity of data they need to find out if their design strategies were effective.

      <h6>feature 3:</h6>
      <h3>engage with your walking community through a social media feed</h3>
      <p>In addition to sharing aggregated user reports, Ramble also encourages walkers to share their walking experiences with
        others in the nearby vicinity via a social media channel. This social media channel helps normalize discussions around
        the threats that women face while walking alone, as well as provide information that could help other walkers make
        more informed decisions and become aware of potentially dangerous situations in the area. Our concept prototype evaluation
        revealed that participants do not necessarily want conversational “social” content and were concerned about the potential
        negative impact of having a stream of horrendous events. We decided to shape the content of the news feed so that
        it includes both user generated content and system generated content that strikes a tone that is more actionable
        and informative. User generated content takes the form of a so-called “heads up” to other walkers in the area, as
        opposed to a forum for venting frustrations. This can also be empowering as our walkers’ experiences could be validated
        by, or overlap, with each others’. In addition to user generated content, the news feed would also include engaging
        system generated content in the form of safety tips and interactive questions and polls, which our research participants
        were very keen on.</p>

      <p>Our primary research surfaced that participants were not confident in their ability to effectively assess or respond
        to risks. We met with a martial arts and self defense instructor, Gailyn Perrin, to understand what knowledge is
        crucial to walking safety, which parts of her curriculum resonate well with students, and what types of information
        can be transferred well through an app. Our resulting education approach manifests in the form of Safety Tips, which
        are brief, casual and relatable tidbits grounded in research. These tips promote awareness of one’s surroundings,
        the importance of paying attention to intuition, how to carry oneself in order to reduce the chances of being targeted,
        and ways to respond to assailants. As recommended by Gailyn, these tips are written to be memorable and simple to
        understand and execute. </p>

              <h6>Our literature review, consisting of ~25 published research articles, surfaced the following themes:</h6>
              <p>1. There are <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">environmental factors</span> that may cue to women that
                they should feel unsafe. These can be, what researchers refer to as social incivilities, physical incivilities,
                and properties of the built environment. These environmental factors also influence the likelihood of a crime
                or attack to occur.</p>
              </br>
              <p>2. In addition to actual safety, it’s important to target <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">perceived safety</span>                as this is what influences the behavior of women.
                <p>
                  </br>
                  <p>
                    3. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Gendered exclusion</span> is the idea that women’s exclusion
                    from space is tied to social constructs. Historically, women have been excluded from walking independently,
                    especially at night, and are still often treated as promiscuous for doing so today. Futher, women tend
                    to be inundated with info from the media, from their parents, from school, from an early age with info
                    about how to keep safe, such as not walking alone. Importantly, what this suggests is that (1) women
                    are taught that their safety is their own responsibility and (2) gendered exclusion perpetuates itself:
                    as long as women feel unsafe walking alone, they will continue to be exluded from the space of walking.
                  </p>
                  </br>
                  <p>4. Our readings informed our primary research methods, stressing the importance of using <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">qualitative research methods</span>,
                    not solely quantitative ones, to gain a nuanced understanding of why walkers fear what they fear.

                  Through our competitive analysis, we conducted a survey of roughly thirty existing products related to walking safety. There
                  are a number of ways in which the current landscape of products are not sufficiently addressing the needs
                  of our target users, but <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">the most obvious failure across a majority of these products is that they underestimate the difficulty that female-identifying walkers have in reaching out to others for help.</span>                  We found our participants are very sensitive to taking action that may be perceived as an overreaction.
                  First, participants seem to be reluctant to contact emergency services in situations in which they do not
                  feel entirely confident that they are in danger. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">Many apps operate on the conceit that apps should provide a streamlined system for contacting the local authorities, but we believe that features like this are likely to go unused outside of situations in which a woman is already in danger and unable to protect herself.</span>                  Second, participants have trouble communicating their fear, even to friends and family. Apps that recognize
                  that there need to be “levels of escalation,” so to speak, encourage users to reach out to friends and
                  family. However, we learned that our participants are extremely preoccupied with not wanting to burden
                  or worry others, especially in scenarios in which the perceived threat far outweighed the actual threat.
                  <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">We believe that a product we create should not make the same assumptions
              about women and their willingness to ask for help that our competitors have made</span>.

                <p> We conducted a popular media scan exploring how the local media covers the topic of sexual assault. Several
                  articles discussed sexual assaults occurring in the University District of Seattle. The UWPD released a
                  total of 24 crime alerts over the past year, six of which contained references to sexual assault. These
                  six instances are shown below, plotted alongside the amount of the local media coverage of sexual assault.
                  As shown, <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">almost all of these references were published in the aftermath of a sexual assault</span>. Of course,
                  this coverage includes news about the events, but also coincides with when the majority of preventative
                  and educational articles are published. In other words, there seems to be a trend indicating that
                  <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">whenever an assault occurs, there is a flood of corresponding articles both about the specific incident,
                    but also about preventive safety measures women can take in order to protect themselves.</span>.This
                  trend illustrates an education cycle that is highly reactive instead of preventative. <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">By the time the media is sharing information about how to be safer in the local environment, it has already become an issue.</span></p>

                Conducting a stakeholder analysis allowed us to examine and visualize the relevant parties involved in solitary walking and safety and to understand how the needs and values of these stakeholders relate. It is clear from the Stakeholder Map that while all stakeholders share a vested interest in increasing safety in some capacity, <span style="background-color:#FFDA5A">safety is
                a multi-dimensional issue and approaches to improving safety vary as does the timeline of intervention (e.g.,
                preventative vs. responsive)</span>. Furthermore, creation of the Stakeholder Map illuminated the fact that the
                various approaches to safety are more nuanced than previously thought (e.g., what we thought of as “prevention”
                can be further broken down into “prevention”, “deterrence”, and “awareness”).</p>
