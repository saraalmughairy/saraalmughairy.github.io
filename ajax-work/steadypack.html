                    <p>To find out what people thought of our concept, we had 23 people view our video and respond to a survey.
                        In this survey, we found that most respondents (82%) sympathized with the problem, attributing shoulder
                        and back pain to improper backpack use. 95% of respondents felt that the SteadyPack may be able to
                        reduce the problem, but only 27% would definitely use it for themselves, mostly because of lack of
                        regular concern for the problem (50%). Respondents also expressed reluctance to install multiple
                        parts, or use a visible backpack accessory.

                    <h5>Is it technically feasible to make SteadyPack?</h5>
                    <p>Our motivation for creating an arduino prototype was twofold: we wanted to evaluate the technical feasibility
                        of providing real-time meaningful information about backpack use and to provide us with a means for
                        user-testing (otherwise we would have had to do a Wizard Of Oz user test). </p>
                    </br>

                    </br>

                    <p>For the scope of this project, we decided to implement two of SteadyPack’s four features using Arduino:
                        informing the user if (1) based on their bodyweight, if their backpack weighs more than the recommended
                        maximum weight and (2) if the weight was unequally distributed across their shoulders. Based on secondary
                        research and sketching out schematics, we predicted that the way to achieve this would be to use
                        pressure sensors under the bag’s straps (to collect info on weight distribution between the shoulders)
                        and under the bag's handle (to operate similarly to a hanging scale).</p>
                    </br>

                    </br>
                    <p>
                        We were unsure ahead of time if we should go with the larger sensors, which would provide less computational noise but risk
                        bending since they would be sandwiched between the user’s straps and shoulders or the smaller sensors,
                        which would would be less likely to bend, but could be less accurate due to spanning less of the
                        contact between the users shoulder’s and straps, so we purchased and tested both. In our early sketches,
                        we imagined using rubber padding in between the sensor and the strap, to better distribute weight
                        over the sensor, reducing noise. We ended up being able to use a couple of layers of electrical tape
                        to achieve the same thing. Even with this padding, there was still too much noise when we tested
                        it, so through our arduino code, we threw out any sensor data that was more that two standard deviations
                        away from the average.

                    <h5>Is SteadyPack usable?</h5>
                    <p>When coming up with the form factor of the model, we decided that we wanted it to self-contained to the
                        backpack (ie., not require a separate smartphone application and computer interface) because we wanted
                        it be useful to a variety of people (e.g., children) and for a variety of activities (e.g., backpacking).
                        We decided the feedback provided should be accessible to both the wearer themselves and others so
                        that in the case of children, caretakers are able to perceive the feedback and assist the children
                        accordingly, meaning it should have some sort of external, visual display. Lastly, we wanted it to
                        be an accessory, not a smart backpack, so that users could retrofit whatever bag they already owned
                        or preferred.</p>

                         
                    </br>
                    <p>Using a laser cutter, acrylic, LED lights, and Velcro, we crafted a clip on accessory that provided feedback
                        using various light patterns. We had to experiment with several patterns of particle board cutting
                        to find a consistency that was flexible enough to fold over the backpack strap without snapping in
                        half, but sturdy enough to hold the display. We wanted to know if users would find the shape and
                        function of the clip it intuitive, so we asked users where they assume the SteadyPack would go.
                        5 out of 5 users tested answered that they would clip it around the strap of the backpack. Users
                        found the lighting interface intuitive, although comprehension was varied slightly. Most users understood
                        the general idea of what the lights indicated, but each user phrased it differenty. Haptic feedback
                        was unanimously preferred over visual feedback using lights. One user mentioned that lights may be more desirable for children, but preferred vibrations over
                        lights for herself. Two parents we interviewed said that in addition to this being helpful for finding out if the pack was too heavy,
                        it could serve as a tool to teach their child how to properly carry excess weight. Overall, users testing the model prototype found the problem relatable
                        and the solution intuitive, but the use of lights on the device less than ideal.
