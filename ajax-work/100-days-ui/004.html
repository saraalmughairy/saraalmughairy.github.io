          <p class="margin-top-20">I went with a mortgage calculator. I wanted to play around with making the controls easier to use for estimating monthly mortgage payments. 
            Typically, mortgage calculator apps have users do some combination of manually typing in numbers, tapping arrow buttons, and/or using a horizontal slider to enter numerical values.
            With this radial concept, the user would simply drag along the border of the circle to adjust amounts. Unlike a horizontal slider, it does not have a start and end point, so as long as the user keeps rotating, the number will decrease or increase (without bounds). 
            Realistically, it would probably still make sense to be able to manually type in precise amounts, but for quick calculations (e.g., assessing affordability on the spot while visiting a home for sale), this interaction might be more user-friendly. To achieve the numbers changing values in the animation, I learned how to use increasing number expressions in Adobe After Effects.</p>
