          <h1>003. Landing Page (Above the Fold)</h1>
          <h5>What's the main focus?
Is it for a book, an album, a mobile app, a product?
Consider important landing page elements
(call-to-actions, clarity, etc.)  </h5>
          <p class="margin-top-20">For this exercise, I wanted to explore a dramatic shift from a dark interface to a white one. 
            Borrowing from my experience with cinematography, I decided to simulate the effect of panning a camera across a light source, which results in a lens flare. 
            By combining animations created in Principle with lighting in After Effects, this splash screen embraces its video production content with a cinematic theme. Once the user hits the landing page, we want them to get drawn into the video-building process, so the call to action seemed obvious.</p>
