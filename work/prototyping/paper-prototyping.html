                    <h5>Create and test a prototype for a smart watch application using paper prototyping methods.
                    </h5>
                    <p>The inspiration for this design arose from a conversation I had with a classmate who acknowledged that
                        aside from functions that require wearability, like biosensor data, anything else a wearable device
                        could do, she’d rather just use her phone for. So I did just that, I created a watch to help locate
                        her preferred device, her phone. The watch provides both the historic functionality of a watch, telling
                        time, as well as communicates with the phone to help the user find it. Specifically, the watch utilizes
                        GPS to assist the user with a map that depicts their position relative to the phone. In addition
                        to providing location information, the watch communicates with the phone to turn on sound, vibration,
                        and/or the phone’s flash, to make the phone easier to find. To make this common process smoother
                        over time, the phone also has an interface that allows the user to log the location they found it
                        at, which then syncs with the watch, so that next time, if the phone is lost in approximately the
                        same location, the watch can tell the user directly where their phone is, without the user needing
                        to use the map.</p>

                    <h5>Creating the Prototype</h5>
                    <p>To create the prototypes, I started by sketching out the events that would happen on each interface and
                        which actions would trigger those events. I then created the watch frame out of cardboard and the
                        strap out of a tweed tourniquet. I went through a few iterations of drawing the actual interface
                        screens, by testing it on myself before trying it on someone else. The screens of the watch were
                        oriented vertically on a long strip of paper that slid in and out of the watch frame. The settings
                        screen on the watch had strips of paper woven into the main interface paper so that the user could
                        toggle the settings on and off by simply moving the strips. For the phone, I made the base out of
                        cardboard and then used a separate index card for each screen. All parts that were not self-contained
                        via a sliding mechanism on the watch or phone, were incorporated by gluing sticky notes to the back
                        of paper or index cards so that they could be added to and removed from the interface easily without
                        losing adhesive. </p>

                    <h5>Testing the Prototype</h5>
                    <p>My goal with user testing was to identify what the user did and did not find intuitive about the design.
                        I told my research participant that their goal was to find their phone using the watch and then had
                        them ‘think aloud’ while on each screen, explaining each decision. I manipulated the device for them,
                        helping to switch between screens. The only thing the participant did not understand was the watch’s
                        Suggestion screen - they thought they were supposed to verify where the phone was not. After going
                        through the process and adding the “Check Couch” option via the phone, they then understood what
                        the Suggestions screen was intended for. I could improve this by renaming the list to Logged Locations,
                        for example. Overall, the design was quite effective and research process went with fewer hiccups
                        than anticipated. I was limited by the paper medium as I was unable to simulate the assistance of
                        sound, vibration, and light on the phone, which could be tremendously helpful to the user trying
                        to find their phone.
