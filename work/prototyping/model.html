          <h5>For this prototyping exercise, I explored the design of Oxo’s hand-held immersion blender.

          </h5>
          <p class="margin-top-20">
            Before creating my three prototypes, I read over the OXO immersion blender product description, watched a few videos of people
            using immersion blenders online, and then finally, sketched out a handful of ides for prototypes. I narrowed
            down my ideas to three main directions, and then used a combination of foam, air-dry clay, tape, and dowels,
            and sink stoppers purchased from the 99 Cent store to bring my prototypes to fruition.

              The user had trouble pressing the correct control on
              the grip because they couldn’t see which button was
              which. If they used it frequently, this design might be
              preferable because they could simply memorize the
              location of the three buttons and be able to use them
              using the same hand they are holding the device
              with, but otherwise, it is too difficult to figure out the
              location of each button. Additionally, given the way
              the device is gripped, the display should be rotated
              90 degrees, though this could prove problematic for
              accommodating left and right-handed users.

                This was the prototype the user preferred the most.
                The user found it easy to hold and manipulate and
                easy to switch speed settings while using it. The user
                pointed out that the change in dimension of the
                cone shape should be less extreme: that nobody’s
                hand is as small as the cone is near the bottom, so
                there is more room to create a more nuanced slope
                in dimension.

                  This prototype did not test well because they was not
                  enough resistance in the spring mechanism (the two
                  handle prongs move together too easily). When the
                  user held it, he wanted to squeeze the two prongs
                  together just to be able to hold the device steadily,
                  not to increase the speed. Otherwise, the placement
                  of things felt intuitive to the user.
