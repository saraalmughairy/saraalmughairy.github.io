          <h1>Immersion Blender</h1>
          <h5>For this prototyping exercise, I explored the design of Oxoâ€™s hand-held immersion blender.

          <p class="margin-top-20">
            Before creating my three prototypes, I read over the OXO immersion blender product description, watched a few videos of people
            using immersion blenders online, and then finally, sketched out a handful of ides for prototypes. I narrowed
            down my ideas to three main directions, and then used a combination of foam, air-dry clay, tape, and dowels,
            and sink stoppers purchased from the 99 Cent store to bring my prototypes to fruition.
