                    <p>I selected Seattle bike-sharing service Pronto as the subject for my video, because I thought it had
                        the most potential for live-action visual demonstration. To show the motivation, usage, and functionality,
                        I developed a narrative about a young professional, new to Seattle, struggling to find a fast and
                        reliable commuting method. Because Pronto’s target user is unlikely to be a cyclist already, I wanted
                        to keep the focus of the video on Pronto in comparison to traditional methods of commuting, not as
                        an alternative to bicycles in general. And because Pronto primarily operates in an area with an especially
                        high percentage of young adults and transplants, I opted for a lighthearted and comedic tone tailored
                        for this demographic. Although this chosen tone lends itself to hyperbolic details for comic effect
                        (being so late to work that the workday is over, losing ten jobs in two weeks, etc.), the visual
                        story transcends the comedic elements and communicates the essential pitch of Pronto: user-friendly
                        bike sharing as a fast, simple option for personal transportation. </p>

                    <h5>Pre-Production</h5>
                    <p>After iterating on the narrative structure and deliberating the most engaging way to communicate the
                        motivation for using Pronto, I wrote a voiceover-driven script that uses the power of creative storytelling
                        to hold the viewer’s attention while conveying the fundamental Pronto experience and its main benefits:
                        speed and ease of use. Reverse-engineering a script to match these benefits, I created a scenario
                        where the main character’s problem is that his transportation options are all too slow or too difficult.
                        He is perpetually late and visibly unhappy. After a brief but substantial exposition of this character
                        and his needs, I presented Pronto as the solution, showing through live demonstration how easy it
                        is to use, and how much faster the character can move with it. As far as digital interface is concerned,
                        I limited the focus to the station kiosk, where the majority of user interaction with Pronto occurs.
                        Although they do have a website and an app (though I can’t find it in the App store), these are largely
                        supplementary and extraneous to the essential user experience. Usage occurs primarily in person at
                        the station. After showing and discussing how the product is used, I ended the script with a light
                        and happy conclusion to the story: now that he uses Pronto, the main character is visibly happier
                        and more punctual.

                    <h5>Production</h5>
                    <p>When watching Pronto’s existing demonstration videos, I found them lacking in style. They felt corporate
                        and too information-driven to engage me as a viewer. I admired the Nest Protect video that we watched
                        in class, and identified cinematic composition as one of many reasons that it drew me in. So for
                        the visual design of my video, I used a combination of camera and composition techniques to achieve
                        a cohesive “look” that would make the video feel filmic, complimenting the use of character-driven
                        narrative to immerse the viewer in a cinematic world. For example, I used wide shots to establish
                        scenes before cutting to close-ups for detail, emulating film grammar. I also used close-up reaction
                        shots to show the character’s emotional response to events, and used shallow focus to guide the viewer’s
                        eye to the subject of the frame. Planning carefully, I made use of high frame rates when shooting,
                        to be slowed down in post. While this effect is easier to achieve than it looks, it did require deliberate
                        strategizing prior to shooting. In addition to the storyboarded shots, supplementary shots and angles
                        were improvised on location. The diversity of environments in the University District made suitable
                        locations for these shots easy to find, so in most cases, the resulting shot is fairly similar to
                        the original storyboarded concept. My two volunteer actors were great to work with, and performed
                        well with minimal direction. The editing was tedious, but I got ample coverage and the shots lined
                        up as expected.

                    <p>Overall, I am very satisfied with the result of the process. The fun, comedic tone may not be suited
                        for every application, but I can see this video being used for a lighthearted pitch, or for online
                        marketing of the service. In my opinion, the limitations of my approach are 1) that it took several
                        days of shooting and editing, and is therefore not really feasible as a draft-quality mockup, and
                        2) that it uses an information-light script that spends time developing character and narrative,
                        instead of cutting right to the chase. Conversely, what works best about it is that it conveys value
                        to potential users in a visual, comprehensible, and entertaining way. Ultimately, I am confident
                        that, despite the hit-or-miss risk, this video holds up as an informational tool to convey the value
                        of the product in a way that viewers will actually remember.</br>
