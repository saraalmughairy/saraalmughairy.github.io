                    </h5>
                    <p>Currently, the vision-impaired community utilizes accessible navigation tools such as google maps to
                        traverse new areas with high-level, spoken directions. These simple left and right commands are helpful
                        at the street level. However, GPS mapping quickly breaks down in smaller, indoor spaces. Navigating
                        around the chairs and tables in a room requires a more precise coordinate mapping than GPS technologies
                        provide. Certain buildings may also block GPS signals all together. After a brief interview with
                        our Subject Matter Expert, Cynthia Bennett, we discovered that an indoor navigation aid serves a
                        real need for the vision-impaired. Cindy explained several situations in which she has struggled
                        to return to a speci c indoor location. For example, when attending a concert at the Seattle symphony,
                        she needed to return to her seat after being delayed by long lines at intermission. Unfortunately,
                        she became disoriented as to the location of her seat and had to nd an usher to guide her. She felt
                        embarrassed about both walking in late and needing help getting to her seat. Here we saw an opportunity
                        for a device that can be used as a type of locator beacon indoors. Ideally, a vision-impaired user
                        would be able to mark their starting location, navigate away from the space, and then access step-by-step
                        directions when it was time to make a return trip. Alternatively, if a vision-impaired user were
                        meeting a friend at a new location, their friend would be able to mark their own path, share it,
                        and allow the vision-impaired user to access detailed directions upon entry to the building.

                    <p>In some senses, this prototyping method is limited (i.e. transitions are limited, less customizable and
                        interactive than coding), but it is quite capable for demonstrating navigation and interactions,
                        which was the goal of this particular process.
