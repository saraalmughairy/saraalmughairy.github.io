          <h5>45% of women in the US reported feeling unsafe walking alone at night</h5>
          <h6>GALLUP 2016</h6>
          </br>
          <p>For the scope of this project, we chose to exclusively focus on women-identifying individuals because the nature
            of women’s fear of walking tends to differ from men’s fear in both its cause and effect: women tend to be afraid
            of sexual violence and sexual harassment in particular, leading them to develop specific preventative strategies
            of distancing themselves in both space and time from potential attackers. Importantly, fear of walking, itself,
            is hypothesized to further restrict the freedoms of women (Pryor et al. 2013). Women’s mobility is restricted
            by the perception of certain spaces as being unsafe, a product of women’s historical exclusion from these spaces,
            and by the harassment and violence they face currently that continues to reduce their inclusion from these spaces.
            Notably, this suggests that walking inequality is a feedback loop: negative walking experiences reduce walking
            behavior, perpetuating the exclusion of women from walking (Koskela, 2000).</p>

            that aid walkers in the midst of an attack, but none that support walkers continuous fears. Due to fear being
            a function of a larger societal issue, we considered solutions beyond the context of the immediate walk.</p>

          <p>A simplified model of our system shows walkers paired with an ability to signal their unease to each other through
            a haptic pulse. Walkers are then able to report incidents that made them feel unsafe to News, and also access
            tips. Meanwhile, data they have created from using the walking feature is stored and aggregated for reports that
            can be sent to city planners or other authorities.</p>

          <h6>feature 1:</h6>
          <h5>Pair with a walking partner.</h5>
            <p>Ramble connects single walkers together in order to virtually monitor each other’s progress towards their respective
              final destinations. In our primary research, we found that participants had a desire to reach out to another
              person during their walk, but were reluctant to do so, citing reasons like wanting to avoid causing friends
              and family to worry, feeling embarrassed about being afraid, and feeling insecure about whether their fears
              were justified. By connecting strangers who are both walking alone, Ramble provides walkers with the presence
              of another person while eliminating the concern of burdening loved ones. Ramble keeps paired walkers identities
              anonymous, meaning walkers do not know each other’s names or exact locations. Walkers only know when their
              partner has departed and whether they have reached their end destination. Personally identifiable information
              is hidden in an effort to reduce the potential for predators to use this information for harmful purposes.
              Participants who tested the prototype of our concept found comfort and value in the other entity being another
              person, as opposed to an automated machine. For this reason, we included humanizing details, such as the region
              a walking partner is currently in, as well as a personalized avatar. Walkers can signal discomfort through
              discreet haptic feedback to their partner by simply pressing the volume button. Partners can provide each other
              with a sense of comfort by reciprocating this button press. This simple interaction allows our users to acknowledge
              their discomfort and express it without the concern of overreacting and without having to look at the phone
              screen, which could distract walkers, making them more vulnerable. Most importantly, it was crucial that this
              interaction was as simple as possible because in threatening situations, executive functioning failure is common.
              Pressing the volume button has additional benefits beyond communicating unease. The button press also captures
              the GPS coordinates of the location where the user felt uneasy. A rapid multi-press can dial 911 where a system
              recording will provide your GPS location to the dispatcher before switching to the phone’s microphone to capture
              live audio. Alternatively, walkers can customize other escalation preferences, such as setting emergency contacts.

          <h5>Location-tagged, qualitative data collection for city planners.</h5>
            <p>Ramble combines location data with qualitative report data to provide organizations with influence on pedestrian
              safety with information regarding areas in which users feel unsafe, as well as information regarding the effectiveness
              of existing interventions. Through literature reviews and subject matter experts, we learned that there are
              different types of environmental factors that may signal to walkers that there is heightened risk of walking
              in a certain area and importantly, contribute to the potential for attack. Fortunately, there are also environmental
              characteristics that may work to deter crime by creating “defensible space," thereby reducing the likelihood
              of attack. It was important that our design solution leverage “Community Activation," which is a Crime Prevention
              Through Environmental Design (CPTED) term used to encourage community members to “work together to ensure each
              other’s safety.” As we learned from a subject matter expert, the most impactful solutions are ones that lower
              the threshold for reporting so that more people share their experiences. When walkers use their volume buttons
              during the walk to signal unease, that information is geo-tagged. Once the walker finishes their walk, they
              can use qualitative tags to describe their walking experience. This form of incident reporting is powerful
              for at least three reasons: first, it empowers walkers to influence their walking environment, second, the
              knowledge that their incident reporting 'makes a difference', may reduce walkers' threshold to report, and
              third, with existing data collection methods, CPTED experts often do not have the scale and specificity of
              data they need to find out if their design strategies were effective.

          <h5>Engage with your walking community through a social media feed.</h5>
            <p>In addition to sharing aggregated user reports, Ramble also encourages walkers to share their walking experiences
              with others in the nearby vicinity via a social media channel. This social media channel helps normalize discussions
              around the threats that women face while walking alone, as well as provide information that could help other
              walkers make more informed decisions and become aware of potentially dangerous situations in the area. Our
              concept prototype evaluation revealed that participants do not necessarily want conversational “social” content
              and were concerned about the potential negative impact of having a stream of horrendous events. We decided
              to shape the content of the news feed so that it includes both user generated content and system generated
              content that strikes a tone that is more actionable and informative. User generated content takes the form
              of a so-called “heads up” to other walkers in the area, as opposed to a forum for venting frustrations. This
              can also be empowering as our walkers’ experiences could be validated by, or overlap, with each others’. In
              addition to user generated content, the news feed would also include engaging system generated content in the
              form of safety tips and interactive questions and polls, which our research participants were very keen on.</p>

          <h5>Learn effective defense strategies through scientifically-backed safety tips.</h5>
            <p>Our primary research surfaced that participants were not confident in their ability to effectively assess or
              respond to risks. We met with a martial arts and self defense instructor, Gailyn Perrin, to understand what
              knowledge is crucial to walking safety, which parts of her curriculum resonate well with students, and what
              types of information can be transferred well through an app. Our resulting education approach manifests in
              the form of Safety Tips, which are brief, casual and relatable tidbits grounded in research. These tips promote
              awareness of one’s surroundings, the importance of paying attention to intuition, how to carry oneself in order
              to reduce the chances of being targeted, and ways to respond to assailants. As recommended by Gailyn, these
              tips are written to be memorable and simple to understand and execute. </p>

                      In order to understand how the construction of urban and digital spaces affect women’s perceived and actual safety, we spoke
                      with Human Centered Design and Engineering faculty member, Daniela Rosner</span>,
                      as well as Seattle Neighborhood Group Senior Program Manager, Tari Nelson-Zagar</span>. We also met
                      with UW staff members tasked with assessing and preventing violence on campus. These individuals include
                      Gillian Wickwire</span>, the UW SafeCampus Violence Prevention Response Program Threat Assessment &
                      Management Specialist, and Natalie Dolci</span>, the UWPD Victim Advocate. We then reached out to Gailyn
                      Perrin</span>, a Taekwondo instructor and self defense expert, to learn more about what individuals
                      can do to protect themselves.

                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p>Major insights that informed our final solution include:</br>
                      1. Our solution should be cognizant of the fallibility of anecdotal information and crime data.</br>
                      2. Effective solutions harness “Community Activation,” enabling community members to “work together to ensure each other’s
                      safety.”
                      </br>
                      3. Our solution must be simple, and cannot require much thought or action from a user in a threatening situation.
                      </br>
                      4. There are crucial, non-physical aspects of self defense that our solution should target, such as awareness, body language,
                      trusting one's intuition, and practicing personal boundaries.</p>

                    <p>Our field research activity, which consisted of us walking along with our participants and eliciting
                      real-time, contextual information, was inherently different from walking alone. We hoped to better
                      understand what causes women to feel safe or unsafe when walking alone at night, as well as the behaviors
                      they engage in to mitigate feelings of unease, without directly intruding on these activities. The
                      diary we created for participants was designed to function as a design probe</span> that would increase
                      the participants’ awareness of their own personal walking habits prior to the semi-structured interviews;
                      we believed this strategy could help us avoid conducting interviews that would garner superficial insights.
                      We also hoped the digital and physical artifacts of the diary study would function as recollection
                      tools</span> and points of discussion in our eventual interviews, a method known as photo elicitation</span>.
                      Photo elicitation is a method used to evoke memories that are difficult to recall through verbal prompts.
                      We used this method in order to surface different, and more personally contextual information. We recruited
                      five participants and instructed them to record 3 - 5 solitary nighttime walking experiences over the
                      course of one week</span>. Our recording process was two-fold: We instructed each participant to track
                      each walk via the running and cycling fitness mobile app, Strava, and also had them to answer a brief
                      questionnaire either in an online survey format or in their paper diary.</p>

                    <p>We conducted field research in which we walked with our participants along a route that they regularly
                      took at night and elicited real-time, contextual information regarding their walking practices</span>
                      and feelings of safety. During these walk-alongs, we observed what routes our participants took and
                      what kinds of behavior they exhibited, asking them questions about it along the way. This allowed us
                      to better understand what contributes to feelings of safety, what behaviors they engage in to feel
                      safer (e.g., avoiding certain streets), and if they any existing walking safety products (e.g., Companion
                      app or carrying mace). Field research allowed us to observe our participants in a natural context,
                      with their organic behavior when walking at night. Unlike our interview and diary studies, this field
                      study gave us the advantage of witnessing what participants actually do, not just what they say they
                      do</span>. Additionally, observation allowed us to be in the actual environment and so we were able
                      to notice problems or behaviors that participants may not be attentive to, and ask them about it on
                      the spot; for example, one of our participants took an extremely inefficient route to get to her final
                      destination, but did not realize it until we inquired about it. </p>

                  <h6>Our literature review, consisting of ~25 published research articles, surfaced the following themes:</h6>
                  <p>1. There are environmental factors</span> that may cue to women that they should feel unsafe. These can
                    be, what researchers refer to as social incivilities, physical incivilities, and properties of the built
                    environment. These environmental factors also influence the likelihood of a crime or attack to occur.</p>
                  </br>
                  <p>2. In addition to actual safety, it’s important to target perceived safety</span> as this is what influences
                    the behavior of women.
                    <p>
                      </br>
                      <p>
                        3. Gendered exclusion</span> is the idea that women’s exclusion from space is tied to social constructs.
                        Historically, women have been excluded from walking independently, especially at night, and are still
                        often treated as promiscuous for doing so today. Futher, women tend to be inundated with info from
                        the media, from their parents, from school, from an early age with info about how to keep safe, such
                        as not walking alone. Importantly, what this suggests is that (1) women are taught that their safety
                        is their own responsibility and (2) gendered exclusion perpetuates itself: as long as women feel
                        unsafe walking alone, they will continue to be exluded from the space of walking.
                      </p>
                      </br>
                      <p>4. Our readings informed our primary research methods, stressing the importance of using qualitative
                        research methods</span>, not solely quantitative ones, to gain a nuanced understanding of why walkers
                        fear what they fear.

                      Through our competitive analysis, we conducted a survey of roughly thirty existing products related to walking safety. There
                      are a number of ways in which the current landscape of products are not sufficiently addressing the
                      needs of our target users, but the most obvious failure across a majority of these products is that
                      they underestimate the difficulty that female-identifying walkers have in reaching out to others for
                      help. We found our participants are very sensitive to taking action that may be perceived as an overreaction.
                      Participants seem to be reluctant to contact emergency services in situations in which they do not
                      feel entirely confident that they are in danger. Many apps operate on the conceit that apps should
                      provide a streamlined system for contacting the local authorities, but we believe that features like
                      this are likely to go unused outside of situations in which a woman is already in danger and unable
                      to protect herself. Second, participants have trouble communicating their fear, even to friends and
                      family. We believe that a product we create should not make the same assumptions
                      about women and their willingness to ask for help that our competitors have made.

                    <p> We conducted a popular media scan exploring how the local media covers the topic of sexual assault. Several
                      articles discussed sexual assaults occurring in the University District of Seattle. The UWPD released
                      a total of 24 crime alerts over the past year, six of which contained references to sexual assault.
                      These six instances are shown below, plotted alongside the amount of the local media coverage of sexual
                      assault. As shown, almost all of these references were published in the aftermath of a sexual assault</span>.
                      Of course, this coverage includes news about the events, but also coincides with when the majority
                      of preventative and educational articles are published. In other words, there seems to be a trend indicating
                      that whenever an assault occurs, there is a flood of corresponding articles both about the specific
                      incident, but also about preventive safety measures women can take in order to protect themselves.</span>.This
                      trend illustrates an education cycle that is highly reactive instead of preventative. By the time the
                      media is sharing information about how to be safer in the local environment, it has already become
                      an issue.</span>

                    Conducting a stakeholder analysis allowed us to examine and visualize the relevant parties involved in solitary walking and
                    safety and to understand how the needs and values of these stakeholders relate. It is clear from the
                    Stakeholder Map that while all stakeholders share a vested interest in increasing safety in some capacity,
                    safety is a multi-dimensional issue and approaches to improving safety vary as does the timeline of intervention
                    (e.g., preventative vs. responsive)</span>. Furthermore, creation of the Stakeholder
                    Map illuminated the fact that the various approaches to safety are more nuanced than previously thought
                    (e.g., what we thought of as “prevention” can be further broken down into “prevention”, “deterrence”,
                    and “awareness”).</p>

                    list of action terms (e.g. magnify, maximize, minimize, combine, substitute, put to another use, re-arrange)
                    and then through sketching and thinking aloud, tried to think of how we could apply those terms to our
                    ideas. For example, by applying the term “substitute” to our Virtual Reality Self- Defense Training concept,
                    we came up with the idea to use the VR game as a tool to help men empathize with the female walking experience.
                    While a quirky process, we found the Action-Verb method to be tremendously useful for building off of

                    be implemented, we formulated a series of five prompts, each focusing on a different aspect of how it
                    could be implemented, and we then performed a brainwriting session. Each prompt was written onto a sheet
                    of paper and then two of us did five minutes of ideation on each prompt, sketching our ideas onto that
                    sheet of paper. Then, without discussing the sketches, we passed the pieces of paper to each other. The
                    next person could review what was already drawn, iterate on the existing sketches, or add any additional
                    ideas they have. At the end of this process, we had a dozen ideas for each stage and then worked together

                  <p>Storyboarding served as a mechanism to describe high-level concepts as opposed to demonstrating low-level
                    interactions (like the flow through a given user interface, for example). We attempted to convey the
                    key requirements of our concepts in a quick and cheap manner that would be difficult to understand in
                    a text format. Our storyboards allowed us to describe the characters (the relevant stakeholders), setting
                    (the environment or context in which the interaction takes place), sequence (what leads a person to use
                    a design and the steps involved in completing tasks supported by the design), and satisfaction (motivation
                    and end result) derived from our proposed concepts. </p>

          <h6>research questions</h6>
          <p>
            1. What is the desired level of social interaction during and the walking experience?</br>
            2. What form and culture should the social media channel have?</br>
            3. What type and form of education are users most perceptive to?</br>
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>methods</h6>
          <p>
            Participants (four female UW students) first interacted with the paper prototype</span>, where they went through
            a sequence of being matched with a theoretical walking partner and went on two five minute walks on campus. After
            the walking activities, we presented participants with paper prototypes representative of other aspects of our
            application, and asked them questions like who they wanted their walking partner to be, their expectations of
            the social channel, and tried to gauge their feelings towards tips and locally-sourced incident report data.
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>findings</h6>
          <p>
            1. Participants validated that the Walking Partner alleviates concerns of burdening or inconveniencing others</span>.
            Further, they strongly and unanimously preferred having another human as the walking partner over an automated
            service.
            </br>
            </br>

            2. Presence of partner is desired during walk, but interactions after the walk should be minimal</span> While
            we thought that users might want to be able to chat with their partners after the walk, especially if anything
            notable happened on their walk, ¾ of our participants actually did not want the option for direct chat at all.</br>
            </br>

            3. Personalized and gradational escalation is desired</span>. 3/4 participants suggested the volume buttons correspond
            with varying levels of response. Based on this finding, we decided to add two levels of escalation during the
            walk (contacting partner with one button press, or police with rapid press).
            </br>
            </br>

            4. Actionable information is preferred over rants about incidents</span>. From this finding, we shaped our feed
            to balance user generated content with educational information and structure user generated content in the form
            of a "heads up", striking a tone that would be empowering, not fear-inducing.

          <h6>research questions</h6>
          <p>
            1. How understandable are the screen flows within our application?
            </br>
            2. How intuitive is the unease button pressing and escalation?
            </br>
            3. Will users be confused by not having a map?
            </br>
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>methods</h6>
          <p>We conducted guerilla testing with our classmates and with two of our subject matter experts using a high fidelity,
            interactive Invision prototype.
            </br>
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>findings</h6>
          <p>
            Participants felt the interface was generally understandable</span> and found the content to be generally desirable.
            However, there was a noticeable lack of clarity in walking flow</span>. We did not provide the participant with
            an onboarding process, nor did our prototype include an instructional overlay for the Walking Partner feature.
            There was confusion over who the walking partners would be and how they would communicate with them. Testing
            with subject matter expert, Tari Nelson-Zagar supported the efficacy of the tagging and incident reporting interaction
            flow and reinforced that this is a solution that could augment existing CPTED procedures</span>. It also highlighted
            a concern regarding anonymity</span> and whether predatory behavior could be mitigated by obscuring personally
            identifiable information. This made us cognizant of the importance of our UI screens clearly communicating that
            a user’s identity is hidden and protected.
