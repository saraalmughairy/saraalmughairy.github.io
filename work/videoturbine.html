          <h6>Video has become increasingly important for businesses —
          </h6>
          <p>Videos are being used more than ever before for advertising products on the internet. Consumers are looking to
            YouTube, Facebook, and eCommerce sites to find product videos that will assist in their online purchase decisions.

          <h6>Yet having videos made is a pain —</h6>
          <p>Despite the increasing volume of videos needed, getting a commercial product video produced has yet to be streamlined.
            The chart below depicts the findings from a survey of US ad buyers who cited the following challenges in buying
            commercial video (% of respondents, eMarketer 2015). </p>

          </br>
          </br>
          <p>
            Video production is associated with high cost, specialized labor, technical jargon and opaque creativity, which makes the
            user experience difficult for
            <i>clients</i> and
            <i>producers</i>.
          </p>
          </br>
          <h6>
            For Clients —
          </h6>
          <p> Budgets for video projects range drastically, from hundreds of dollars to millions, with sometimes seemingly little
            difference between end results. This leaves clients feeling uncertain about the value of money spent on video
            services, and wary of being taken advantage of.
            <p>
              </br>
              <h6>
                For Producers —
              </h6>
              <p> Because clients are often cautious or unfamiliar with the video production process, producers bear the responsibility
                of proving their worth- explaining and justifying costs, and reassuring clients of shared expectations. Producers
                are worried that clients will be unsatisfied with work produced, and are similarly wary of being exploited
                or cheated.
              </p>
              </br>

              <p>Overall, this lack of mutual trust and understanding results in friction and reduced efficiency throughout
                the entire process for both parties.</p>

          <h6>How can we make Product Video Production more accessible?</h6>

          <p>
            A survey of 15 video production company websites revealed strong similarities in process descriptions. A subject matter expert
            interview confirmed this process description and added qualitative insights regarding workload and client concerns
            during each step. A contextual inquiry of EvanScottMoore.com's video production process surfaced extreme inefficiency
            in the pre-production and post-production communication process. The vast majority of the time is spent on client-producer
            communication, not creating videos. Clients have the same questions over and over, resulting in on average 30
            emails per step, which is difficult to keep track of and time consuming. This chart depicts a typical video production
            process, as described by this research.

            Also surfaced in the competitive analysis, is that video production companies treat each video project as a unique idea,
            with a creative process that can last for weeks and cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to several million.
            While certain videos may require a full creative process (e.g., comedic or cinematic tv commercials), many videos
            designed for eCommerce and social media ("Insider" style product demos, "Tasty" style aerial food recipe videos)
            are strikingly similar in style and content, presenting the opportunity for a streamlined approach.



            <!--             
            It is highly probable that time and money is being wasted on applying this bespoke
            creative process to templatable video types, such as eCommerce product videos, which are homogenous in style
            and content, and built for delivery of information rather than creative storytelling. -->

            The user begins by using our Video Builder tool to select a product video template (full actor demo, hand demo, or 360 spin).
            They are then provided with options based on that template (e.g., backdrop color). By having full control over
            these options and completely transparent pricing, they are able to feel confident about the details of their
            video prior to submitting the order. Once they submit the order, they simply print out a shipping label and send
            us their product. During this waiting period, they are never in the dark- the online order tracker updates them
            at each step of the production process. Once the first cut of the edit is complete, the user can review the video
            in browser and easily request edits using time-stamped comments while watching the video. Once the user is satisfied
            with the video, they download link to their video in web and social-media-ready formats, as well as all raw footage.

          <!-- 
      If the client
        wishes to have a voiceover or actor speaking in the video, they will need a script made. Through user research,
        we aimed to simplify the script-writing process, and ultimately found that all clients need to do is send over
        a list of product features. We can then respond with a script for their review. Once the client approves the script, they
        print out their shipping label, send us their product, and wait. -->

                      is a lack of clarity and transparency regarding cost, end product, and timeline</b>. The only option for
                      potential clients is to submit a quote request form, which seems incredibly cumbersome for clients
                      who are in the research phase of their project and shopping around for potential producers.</p>

                    <p>
                      Average video costs typically fall into the range of a few thousand dollars (1-10), with most traditional video product companies
                      claiming that their competitors charge more than they do, without listing specific prices. Standard
                      practice among traditional video production companies is to require project-specific information before
                      providing any form of a price quote. This contributes to an atmosphere of opacity that might discourage
                      inexperienced users. Animation companies are more forthright with their prices, often times including
                      ballpark figures in their online ads. However, the inherent differences between animation and live-action
                      video prevent much competition between types; users are either looking for animation specifically or
                      live action specifically, the two are not competitive or interchangeable. Despite these differences,
                      both animation and live-action producers typically fall into the same range of 1-10 thousand dollars
                      for an average 1-3 minute product video. “Product demo video” is a key term used by both animators
                      and live-action video producers to describe their services. This makes it harder to find either specific
                      service type in a list of search engine results. <b>Furthermore, most live-action video companies offer
                      but do not specialize in product demonstration videos</b>. Therefore a user looking for live-action product
                      demo video production may find it difficult to identify the best choice for their needs, due to the
                      presence of animation, overall market saturation, and indistinguishable competitors.

                    <h6>Expert Interview -</h6>

                    <p>A semi-structured 'expert interview' with the founder of EvanScottMoore.com
                      <b>yielded insight into the lack of transparency provided by production companies as well as pain points
                        in his process.</b>
                      </br>
                      </br>
                      <b>Sample Key Findings:</b>
                      </br>
                      1. 5/10 of last year’s non-repeat clients were recruited directly through Evan’s website. People are hand-picking Evan based
                      on work he has already done and given SEO, likely doing a lot of research to find him. The majority
                      of his clients send him a link to a video that he's created that is similar to what they want. This
                      suggests that potential <b>clients find relevant portfolio content compelling</b> and a means to communicate.
                      </br>
                      2. Evan’s wishes there was a way to <b>provide his clients updates on their projects without direct communication</b>. He regularly
                      receives emails and phone calls just checking up on things, even when the project is going according
                      to schedule.
                      </br>3.Evan’s <b>clients feel underprepared to have a video made</b> (e.g., they don’t realize all they need
                      for a script is a list of product features). They often feel surprised that it's not that hard and
                      from there on have him make several more videos. Demistyfing the process up front may increase customer
                      conversion and decrease their anxiety about the process.</br>
                      4. Clients are confused about what is relevant or possible in post production (e.g., they often ask about green screen).
                      He wishes he could make it more clear what is easy and difficult to do, what influences pricing, and
                      what he needs from the client in order to create their video.

                    <h6>Email Case Study -</h6>
                    <p>
                      <b>An analysis of email conversation from a product video project from start-to-finish uncovered extreme
                        inefficiency in communication throughout the video production process.</b>
                      Despite this project being "faster and less involved than usual", communication during the pre-production phase involved
                      25 emails (in addition to phone conversations) and 3 weeks of back-and-forth. Post-production conversation
                      was similarly lengthy, at 23 emails and 1.5 weeks of back-and-forth. This means the majority of the
                      time was spent on clarifying content as opposed to shooting and editing the video. 15 of these emails
                      were simply confirmation emails (e.g., Evan confirming that he received an asset, client confirming
                      that they are okay with suggested change, etc). This suggests a need for a dedicated space to have
                      discussions with an easy way to indicate confirmation.

                    <p>Cognitive and market research show that people tend to be happier, less anxious, and more confident making
                      choices when there are fewer options (known as the Paradox of Choice). There is a reason why Squarespace
                      is more user friendly than Wix: Squarespace provides choice within limitation, whereas Wix promotes
                      customizing every pixel. How many of us have spent hours designing our own sneakers on NikeID, only
                      to never actually purchase them, opting instead for their predesigned shoes despite the price similarity?
                      After our collaborative design exercise, we felt that using an interface to 'shop' video features could
                      take the place of an in-person consultation, and that the added transparency could increase users'
                      confidence about what their resulting video would look like. Of course, we were wary of overwhelming
                      users by requiring them to choose every little detail about the video: We wanted users to have just
                      enough control to feel confident about what they were ordering, without burdening them with too much
                      choice.

                      So, we sought out to test what was the abolute minimal information a video producer needed in order to create the product
                      video the user had in mind. Despite Evan's lengthy consulation meetings and emails with clients as
                      a freelancer, he felt that he only required the following information from them: whether they wanted
                      a solid-color backdrop or studio location, whether there would be actors involved, and what specific
                      features of the product should be demonstrated. I found a video of a product demo online and attempted
                      to have Evan recreate it without him ever watching it. I only provided him with the kinds of details
                      easily attained from an interface (Backdrop color, Voiceover or Actor Speaking on Camera, Captions
                      or No Captions, Duration, and Script). The resulting video was, in our opinion, comparable in style
                      and content, and equivalent or better in quality. 
                      Through this prototyping test, we verified that <b>it is indeed feasible to produce high quality product videos using limited
                      instructions communicated solely through an interface</b>. We also realized that <b>we either need to limit
                      the types of products we create videos for, or provide a few more options that are product-specific</b>.
                      For instance, in the video Evan reproduced for this exercise, the original actor wears the product
                      (boots) for a few seconds on camera. If we were to offer apparel videos, we would need to either enable
                      users to specify whether the apparel should be worn and how (e.g., the original actor had pants that
                      covered the upper portion of the boots), or alternatively, make it clear that the apparel will not
                      be showcased on an actual person. Lastly, in this exercise, I provided a verbatim copy of the original
                      script, which many of Evan's regular clients do, but we hypothesized that we could reduce the workload
                      of many clients by having them instead provide a list of product features, and have us generate a draft
                      of a script for them, along with a corresponding shot list that makes it clear what visual will be
                      displayed during each line of the script (e.g., when the script says "This shoe has a flexible sole",
                      a corresponding note might say "Actor uses both hands to slightly bend shoe").

                    <p>We created a prototype of Video Turbine that is a live, fully functioning WooCommerce
                      <a href="https://videoturbine.com/product/custom-product-videos/#video-template" target="_blank">website.</a> The decision to use WooCommerce was a tradeoff between control over visual design and functionality, but
                      we ultimately decided while typically, mockups can test the usability and desirability of a product,
                      that the increased functionality and authenticity of a real eCommerce site would help us better assess
                      whether businesses would actually be willing to 'shop' for their video online, the same way they would
                      use an eCommerce site to buy other products. Additionally, to assess desirability, we created an explainer
                      video (see above) for the service which we intend to send around to business owners along with a questionaire.
                      Lastly, throughout the website, we are collecting constant feedback through a Suggestion Box form and
                      a Desired Features poll. So far, we have sent our video and site on to 3 businesses we are connected with and have had valuable feedback, but we will much better be able to evaluate desirability once we put it in front of actual potential customers.</p>

                      that was not created by Video Turbine). This simple exercise gave us extremely valuable insights both
                      about micro-interactions on the site and copy improvements, but also on desired features. The photo to the left is
                      an example of feedback from one step in the video-building process.

          <h6>Testing Desirability and Usability of Video Turbine —</h6>
          </br>

          <p>We created a prototype of Video Turbine that is a live, fully functioning WooCommerce
            <a href="https://videoturbine.com/product/custom-product-videos/#video-template" target="_blank">website.</a> This decision was a tradeoff between control over visual design and functionality, but we ultimately
            decided while typically, mockups can test the usability and desirability of a product, that the increased functionality
            and authenticity of a real eCommerce site would help us better assess whether businesses would actually be willing
            to 'shop' for their video online, the same way they would use an eCommerce site to buy other products. Additionally,
            to assess desirability, we created an explainer video (see above) for the service which we intend to send around
            to business owners along with a questionaire. Lastly, throughout the website, we are collecting constant feedback
            through a Suggestion Box form and a Desired Features poll.</p>

          <h6>How can we make Video Turbine more usable? —</h6>
          </br>
          <p>
            To find ways to improve the usability of interactions on Video Turbine, we sat down with 3 of our friends and had them build
            a video while thinking aloud and explaining what they thought each step and feature was. They were instructed
            to 'build a video that looks like this' (we showed them an example video that was not created by Video Turbine).
            This simple exercise gave us extremely valuable insights both about micro-interactions on the site and copy improvements,
            but also on desired features. Below is an example of feedback from one step in the video-building process.

          <h6>What is the minimal amount of information needed from a business to create our most complicated product video?
            —
          </h6>
          </br>


          <p>Cognitive and market research show that people tend to be happier, less anxious, and more confident making choices
            when there are fewer options (known as the Paradox of Choice). There is a reason why Squarespace is more user
            friendly than Wix: Squarespace provides choice within limitation, whereas Wix promotes customizing every pixel.
            How many of us have spent hours designing our own sneakers on NikeID, only to never actually purchase them, opting
            instead for their predesigned shoes despite the price similarity? After our collaborative design exercise, we
            felt that using an interface to 'shop' video features could take the place of an in-person consultation, and
            that the added transparency could increase users' confidence about what their resulting video would look like.
            Of course, we were wary of overwhelming users by requiring them to choose every little detail about the video:
            We wanted users to have just enough control to feel confident about what they were ordering, without burdening
            them with too much choice.</p>

            So, we sought out to test what was the abolute minimal information a video producer needed in order to create the product
            video the user had in mind. Despite Evan's lengthy consulation meetings and emails with clients as a freelancer,
            he felt that he only required the following information from them: whether they wanted a solid-color backdrop
            or studio location, whether there would be actors involved, and what specific features of the product should
            be demonstrated. I found a video of a product demo online and attempted to have Evan recreate it without him
            ever watching it. I only provided him with the kinds of details easily attained from an interface (Backdrop color,
            Voiceover or Actor Speaking on Camera, Captions or No Captions, Duration, and Script). The resulting video was,
            in our opinion, comparable in style and content, and equivalent or better in quality. We are in the process of
            conducting a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, to find out from an unbiased audience which of the two videos
            demonstrates higher quality, which video they prefer, and which video better represented the product. I will
            post the results when this survey is complete. The competing videos can be viewed above.

          <p>Through this prototyping test, we verified that it is indeed feasible to produce high quality product videos using
            limited instructions communicated solely through an interface. We also realized that we either need to limit
            the types of products we create videos for, or provide a few more options that are product-specific. For instance,
            in the video Evan reproduced for this exercise, the original actor wears the product (boots) for a few seconds
            on camera. If we were to offer apparel videos, we would need to either enable users to specify whether the apparel
            should be worn and how (e.g., the original actor had pants that covered the upper portion of the boots), or alternatively,
            make it clear that the apparel will not be showcased on an actual person. Lastly, in this exercise, I provided
            a verbatim copy of the original script, which many of Evan's regular clients do, but we hypothesized that we
            could reduce the workload of many clients by having them instead provide a list of product features, and have
            us generate a draft of a script for them, along with a corresponding shot list that makes it clear what visual
            will be displayed during each line of the script (e.g., when the script says "This shoe has a flexible sole",
            a corresponding note might say "Actor uses both hands to slightly bend shoe").

            We sure hope so! We are in the process of using a combination of our live prototype, our explainer video, and Google Analytics
            to see if we can gain traction!
